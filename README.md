# SimphonyClientLogVerbosityIncreaser

Based on the support requests we have received. By default, Simphony is configured to retain logs only up to a capacity of 10MB, after which they are automatically purged. To ensure that we can identify and address issues using log files even if they are reported a few days later, I propose increasing the log verbosity level to 100MB and maintaining log archives on each workstation, including the CAPS server.

Go to All Workstations and CAPS 
Run the Application
